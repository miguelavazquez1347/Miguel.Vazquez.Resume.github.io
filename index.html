  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m Miguel Vazquez, an IT professional from Massachusetts. From a young age, I fell in love with computers — especially video games. That passion quickly turned into a curiosity about how computers worked and how they connected to each other.</p>

  <p>I vividly remember my first computer: a Dell OptiPlex, and spending hours playing Diablo II on it. Those early experiences laid the groundwork for my interest in technology. In high school, I took an elective course called “Introduction to Computer Science.” It was there that I learned how to write, compile, and run Java programs. I really enjoyed the challenge — it was something new and completely different for me.</p>

  <p>After graduating high school, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science. At Elms College, I gained a strong foundation in the tech world — from programming in C# and Python, to learning Linux, networking, and cybersecurity. Cybersecurity especially became one of my favorite subjects during my time in college.</p>

  <p>Before graduating, I joined an internship at a nonprofit IT training organization in my local city. It was an amazing experience — not just because I got hands-on with Raspberry Pis, repaired desktop PCs, and dove deeper into networking and subnetting — but because I met other passionate individuals who shared my love for technology.</p>

  <p>That internship ultimately led to another opportunity, and I’m now working full-time at the company where I completed my second internship — continuing to grow, learn, and do what I love.</p>
