        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I’m Miguel Vazquez, an IT professional from Massachusetts. From a
          young age, I fell in love with computers — especially video games.
          That passion quickly turned into a curiosity about how computers
          worked and how they connected to each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          I vividly remember my first computer: a Dell OptiPlex, and spending
          hours playing Diablo II on it. Those early experiences laid the
          groundwork for my interest in technology. In high school, I took an
          elective course called “Introduction to Computer Science.” It was
          there that I learned how to write, compile, and run Java programs. I
          really enjoyed the challenge — it was something new and completely
          different for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduating high school, I decided to pursue a degree in
          Computer Science. At Elms College, I gained a strong foundation in
          the tech world — from programming in C# and Python, to learning
          Linux, networking, and cybersecurity. Cybersecurity especially became
          one of my favorite subjects during my time in college.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before graduating, I joined an internship at a nonprofit IT training
          organization in my local city. It was an amazing experience — not
          just because I got hands-on with Raspberry Pis, repaired desktop PCs,
          and dove deeper into networking and subnetting — but because I met
          other passionate individuals who shared my love for technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          That internship ultimately led to another opportunity, and I’m now
          working full-time at the company where I completed my second
          internship — continuing to grow, learn, and do what I love.
